# skilcrypt

Want cross platform encryption and decryption program ? Read on.

Wrote this GnuPG wrapper because I wanted **not only** to encrypt my files, but to access them from other operating systems.

You won't have access to X operating system all the time, and the need to decrypt and use your files in Z operating system will force you to seek cross platform encryption.

Here are some real facts that made me to write skilcrypt:  I was abroad for half year and realised how limited LUKS is, as I wasn't able to access my files as I had only smartphone. The ironic thing is that the encrypted files was stored on microsd card.


[eCryptfs](https://defuse.ca/audits/ecryptfs.htm) and [EncFS](https://defuse.ca/audits/encfs.htm) are pretty much out of the game.
